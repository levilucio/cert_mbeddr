\emph{mbeddr}’s projectional editing plays an important role in easing Cdevelopment and in making the software engineer moreproductive~\cite{VoelterRKS13}.\markus{It is really the extensions that make things better. And the editor is away to build these extensions.} However, when critical systems are developed,additional guarantees of correctness are required. It is often the case that forsuch systems guarantees are provided using a set of di- verse techniques andtechnologies\markus{That sentence has very little content}.For example, a combination of testing, model checking, code reviews andtraceability between the artifacts used throughout the development might be usedto build enough confidence in the final product.With this project we propose making use of \emph{mbeddr}’s native capabilitiesto allow the creation, maintenance and reuse of convincing technical and logicalarguments that support the claim that the C code produced using the\emph{mbeddr} front-end is certified to be correct.
