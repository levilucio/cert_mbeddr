\emph{mbeddr} is a projectional editor that includes a set of extensions to C'snative syntax. These extensions ease the development of embedded software basedon C and make the software engineer moreproductive~\cite{VoelterRKS13}.However, when critical systems are developed, certain guarantees of correctnessare required. For this purpose, various techniques and technologiescan be used. For example, a combination of testing, model checking, codereviews and traceability between the artifacts used throughout the developmentmight be used to build enough confidence in the final product.\vspace{2mm}\noindent\textbf{With this project we propose making use of \emph{mbeddr}'s native capabilitiesto allow the creation, maintenance and reuse of convincing technical and logicalarguments that support the claim that the C code produced using the\emph{mbeddr} front-end is certified to be correct.} \vspace{2mm}\noindentA more strategic objective is to promote \emph{mbeddr} as a research toolat fortiss, where advanced software engineering tools can be prototyped. Thereis a natural symbiotic relationship between the research proposed by this project andthe commercial \emph{mbeddr} tool being developed at itemis AG:itemis AG deals with clients who will have real-world problems that requireadvanced technical solutions; fortiss GmbH can provide a testbed to prototypesuch technical solutions.% % \markus{I am strongly against% these two flavors! We should talk about what the two companies do with mbeddr,% but not about two ``Kinds'' of mbeddr.}We place particular importance in achieving a robust and stable\emph{cert-mbeddr} tool that can be used as an exploration tool both forthe industrial world and for the academic community.
