\emph{mbeddr} is a projectional editor that includes a set of extensions to C'snative syntax. These extensions ease the development of C applications and makethe software engineer more productive~\cite{VoelterRKS13}.However, when critical systems are developed, certain guarantees of correctnessare required. For this purpose, diverse techniques and technologiescan be employed. For example, a combination of testing, model checking, codereviews and traceability between the artifacts used throughout the developmentmight be used to build enough confidence in the final product.With this project we propose making use of \emph{mbeddr}'s native capabilitiesto allow the creation, maintenance and reuse of convincing technical and logicalarguments that support the claim that the C code produced using the\emph{mbeddr} front-end is certified to be correct. A more strategic objectiveis to (re)-establish \emph{mbeddr} as a fortiss research product, where advancedsoftware engineering tools can be prototyped. There is a natural symbioticrelation between the \emph{fortiss-mbeddr} and the itemis AG \emph{mbeddr}:being a production tool, the itemis AG \emph{mbeddr} will be used byclients who will provide real-world problems that require advanced technicalsolutions; being a research tool, the \emph{fortiss-mbeddr} will provide atestbed to prototype such technical solutions.We place particular importance in achieving a robust and stable\emph{fortiss-mbeddr} tool such that can be used as an exploration tool both forthe industrial world and for the academic community.
