\paragraph{\textbf{Objective}}: To automatically provide information ontraceability between the requirements for an \emph{mbeddr} specification, the \emph{mbeddr}specification itself and the generated C code.\vspace{.2cm}\\Traceability is a fundamental artifact to enable certification: it allowsknowing which requirements are implemented in the final software product and howthat implementation was done. In the context of \emph{mbeddr}, traceability links allartifacts used throughout the development of embedded C software, starting froma set of requirements and finishing with the generated code. This work package will concentrate on replacing the current traceabilitymanagement mechanism between an \emph{mbeddr} specification and theautomatically generated C code. This is necessary due tothe fact that the new model-to-model transformation language introduced by WorkPackage 1 introduces its own traceability management mechanism.%  a new model transformation language for code generation will be% introduced in \emph{mbeddr} by Work Package~\ref{sec:wp1}, MPS-based% traceability between the abstract syntax elements of an \emph{mbeddr}% specification and the abstract syntax elements of the generated C code will need%  have to be created, stored and managed.% such that this information can be used for certification activities.% \markus{Sorry to be a PITA, but this formulation really does not make sense.% There are two kinds of traceability: those traces entered manually by users% between model model elements (eg from code to requirements). THis is already% done by mbeddr, and there really is nothing to do. It's done. The other one is% the automatic trace used by MPS internally to track how, during% transformations, nodes are transformed into other nodes. This is also done, but% only for MPS' existing trafo languages. Now, you have two options for what you% can do: 1) you make sure that your new trafo language also creates these% MPS-based traces during trafo. This is important for eg debugging. 2) you may% want to create reports on that data that can be used during certification.}\begin{itemize}  \item Deliverables:  \begin{itemize}    \item{\textbf{D2.1}:} Prototype within \emph{mbeddr} for storing, in MPS    format, the traceability information produced by the model-to-model transformation    language introduced by Work Package 1.    \item{\textbf{D2.2}:} Prototype within \emph{mbeddr} for creating reports on    traceability from requirements to the generated C code. These reports are to be used as    part of an argument that the generated C code is certified to be    correct.\vspace{.15cm}  \end{itemize}  \item Effort: 5 man-months  \item HQP: Levi L\'ucio, staff researcher, M.Sc. student, HiWi student   \item Collaborations: Members of the IETS3 project.\end{itemize}
