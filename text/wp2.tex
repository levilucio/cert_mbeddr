\paragraph{\textbf{Objective}}: To establish explicit traceability mechanismsfor a C application developed in \emph{mbeddr}, from the requirements tothe generated code.\vspace{.2cm}\\Traceability is a fundamental artifact to enable certification as it allowsknowing which requirements are implemented in the final software product and howthat implementation was done. In the context of \emph{mbeddr}, traceability links allartifacts used throughout the development of embedded C software, starting froma set of requirements and finishing with the generated code. Given that a new model transformation language for code generation will beintroduced in \emph{mbeddr} by Work Package~\ref{sec:wp1}, currenttraceability mechanisms within \emph{mbeddr} will have to be reviewed andadapted. In particular, it will be necessary to build and store traces betweenthe abstract syntax element of the \emph{mbeddr} language and of the \emph{C}language.%\markus{mbeddr's existing trafo lang does this.}\begin{itemize}  \item Deliverables:  \begin{enumerate}    \item Prototype in \emph{mbeddr} for building and storing explicit traceability    from the embedded application requirements, to the corresponding \emph{mbeddr}    specification abstract syntax, to the corresponding abstract syntax tree for    the generated C code.  \end{enumerate}  \item Effort: 2 man-months  \item HQP: Levi L\'ucio, Zaur Molotnikov, Hiwis student  \item Collaborations: Members of the IETS3 project.\end{itemize}
