Traceability is a fundamental artifact to enable certification as it allowsknowing which requirements are implemented in the final software product and howthat implementation was done. In the context of \emph{mbeddr}, traceability links allartifacts used throughout the development of embedded C software, starting froma set of requirements and finishing with the generated code. Althoughtraceability between artifacts (textual requirements, \emph{mbeddr} code and C code) isnatively supported by \emph{mbeddr}, the traceability between \emph{mbeddr} specifications andthe generated C code connects abstract syntax to lines of code. \emph{mbeddr}developers have expressed the desire to have more advanced and informativetraceability built in terms of how an abstract syntax tree of an \emph{mbeddr}specification is related to the abstract syntax tree of the generated C code.The introduction of model transformation languages in \emph{mbeddr}, as proposed inWork Package 1, provides a technical base to tackle this problem.\markus{mbeddr's existing trafo lang does this.}\begin{itemize}  \item Deliverables:  \begin{enumerate}    \item Prototype in \emph{mbeddr} for building and storing explicit traceability    from the embedded application requirements, to the corresponding \emph{mbeddr}    specification abstract syntax, to the corresponding abstract syntax tree for    the generated C code.  \end{enumerate}  \item Effort: 2 man-months  \item HQP: Levi L\'ucio\end{itemize}
