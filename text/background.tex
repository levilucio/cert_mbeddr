The C language lends itself to writing compact and efficient code in terms of
speed and space, for a multitude of computer architectures. It is thus naturally
heavily used in the development of embedded systems. C's expressiveness comes
nonetheless at a price: compact notation together with the language's flexible
semantics (e.g. at the level of memory management) makes it such that
non-intended behaviors can easily happen at run-time. This is due to the fact
that C programs often contain complex program statements that are syntactically
correct, but for which the semantics are difficult to understand and predict. Given that C is
very often used to develop safety-critical systems, it is fundamental to provide
C programmers with tools that assist them in writing correct code.

In order to address these issues, the \emph{mbeddr} editor for the C language
has been built~\cite{SzaboVKRS14}. \emph{mbeddr} is a projectional editor based
on JetBrains’ MPS\footnote{https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/)}.
The principle of projectional editing is that code is written as a model that is
a composition of instances of concepts of the C language. The advantages of
projectional editing when compared to classical text editing are many:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The programmer can only make use of the valid and finite set of language
  constructs and their instances available at any point in the code. This is a
  step beyond classical text-based code editors in that writing syntactically
  correct code is guaranteed by construction.
  \item \emph{mbeddr} leverages the flexible language definition environment of MPS,
  allowing the definition and usage of modular extensions for the C language
  that allow the programmer to concentrate on the essential complexity of the problem
  at hand while avoiding the accidental complexity of C’s notation.
  \item Automated model transformations are used to automatically fill in the
  details abstracted by the extensions. This ensures that the error prone code
  avoided by the abstractions proposed by the editor is filled in automatically
  and correctly into the final project’s compilable and runnable C code.
\end{itemize}
