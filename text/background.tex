The C language lends itself to writing compact and efficient code in terms of
speed and space, for a multitude of computer architectures. It is thus naturally
heavily used in the development of embedded systems. C’s expressiveness comes
nonetheless at a price: the language is notionally heavy and its flexibility
(e.g. at the level of memory management) makes it such that non-intended
behaviors can occur due to complex program statements that are syntactically
correct, but for which the semantics are difficult to understand and predict.
Given that C is very often used to develop safety-critical systems, it is
fundamental to provide C programmers with tools that assist them in writing
correct code.

In order to address these issues, the \emph{mbeddr} editor for the C language has been
built\cite{SzaboVKRS14}. \emph{mbeddr}\footnote{Based on JetBrains’ MPS
(https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/)} is a projectional editor, which means code is
written as a model that combines a number of instances of concepts of the C
language. The advantages when comparing projectional editing with classical text
editing are many:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The programmer can only make use of the valid and finite set of language
  constructs and their instances available at any point in the code. This is a
  step beyond classical text-based code editors in that writing syntactically
  correct code is granted by construction.
  \item \emph{mbeddr} leverages the flexible language definition environment of MPS,
  allowing the definition and usage of abstractions for the C language that
  allow the programmer to concentrate on the essential complexity of the problem
  at hand while avoiding the accidental complexity of C’s notation.
  \item Automated model transformations are used to automatically fill in the
  details abstracted by the editor. This ensures that the error prone code
  avoided by the abstractions proposed by the editor is filled in automatically
  and correctly into the final project’s compilable and runnable C code.
\end{itemize}
