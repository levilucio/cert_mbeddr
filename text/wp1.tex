% The \emph{mbeddr} editor helps the developer writing correct C code. On the one% hand, \emph{mbeddr}â€™s front-end helps the developer by providing editing% assistance and good abstractions. On the other other hand, the generated code% can be verified using the CBMC\cite{KroeningT14} C model checker, there are no guarantees that the% semantics of the \emph{mbeddr} C specification is kept in the generated% code% % \markus{I don't quite understand why you mention CBMC here.% Doesn't it provide (some of the) assertions you are aiming for? I would omit% this here, and in a separate paragraph explain, how and why unit testing and% even CBMC are not good enough.}.%  Currently, the verification infrastructure% within \emph{mbeddr} includes: a framework for unit-testing; the% CBMC\cite{KroeningT14} C model checker for analysing the generated C code.% Unfortunately these techniques alone or even together are not sufficient to% make sure that the generated C code is correct, as none of them explicitly% targets the relation betweem\paragraph{\textbf{Objective}}: To provide the technical means within\emph{mbeddr} that allow verifying the generated C code is correctlyproduced.\vspace{.2cm}\\One of the main bottlenecks when trying to provide an argument for thecorrectness of the C code generated from \emph{mbeddr} lies in the fact that thecode generators that transform high-level \emph{mbeddr} C extensions intolow-level C code cannot be explicitly verified. This is a crucial problem forthe adoption of \emph{mbeddr} in practice: a case needs to be made for thevalidity of the generated C code. Making this case will encourage C developersto use the tool; its omission may prevent \emph{mbeddr} from being used for thedevelopment of critical systems, one of the domains the tool is potentially mostuseful for. Verifying code generation falls in the domain of the analysis ofmodel transformations and can be tackled using the approach describedin~\cite{Lucio2014,Oakes2015}.Note that because \emph{mbeddr} is built with MPS, work on verifying codegeneration within \emph{mbeddr} can be used for other code generators withinthe MPS framework itself. This will allow us to reach a broader audience for ourresults and to open perspectives for more industrial collaborations and deeper scientific insights.% \levi{What is the size of the MPS% community?

Cl\'audio Gomes and Bentley Oakes will provide expertise on  model transformation languages and their analysis. A collaboration between Levi   L\'ucio and Markus Voelter related to this work  package has been ongoing informally during most of the year of 2015.\end{itemize}
