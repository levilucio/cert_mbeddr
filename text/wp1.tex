Currently, one of the main bottlenecks when trying to provide an argument forthe correctness of the C code generated from \emph{mbeddr} lies in the fact that thecode generators that transform \emph{mbeddr} C specifications into real C code are notverified. This amounts to saying that, although: 1) \emph{mbeddr}â€™s front-end helps thedeveloper by providing editing assistance and good abstractions; and 2) thegenerated code can be verified using the CBMC\cite{KroeningT14} C/C++ modelchecker, there are no guarantees that the semantics of the \emph{mbeddr} C specification is kept in thegenerated code. This is a crucial problem for the adoption of \emph{mbeddr} inpractice: a case needs to be made for the validity of the generated C code. Notonly will this encourage C developers to use the tool, as its omission mayindeed prevent \emph{mbeddr} from being used for the development of critical systems,one of the main domains the tool is aimed at. Verifying code generation falls inthe domain on the analysis of model transformations and can be tackled using theapproach described in\cite{Lucio2014,Oakes2015}.The language used for code generation within \emph{mbeddr} is same as the one usedwithin the MPS framework. Because of this, the work on verifying code gener-ation within \emph{mbeddr} can be naturally generalized to the MPS framework itself,reaching in this way a broader audience for these results and openingperspectives for more industrial collaborations and deeper scientificinsights.\levi{What is the size of the MPS community? Would this be interestingfor that community?}\begin{itemize}  \item Deliverables:  \begin{enumerate}    \item A prototype within \emph{mbeddr} of a model-to-model transformation languagewithin \emph{mbeddr} to replace current model-to-text code generators.	\item A prototype within \emph{mbeddr} of a pre- / post-condition contract prover formodel-to-model transformations within \emph{mbeddr}.	\item A technical proof of the correctness of the C code generator for \emph{mbeddr}.  \end{enumerate}  \item Effort: 6 man-months  \item HQP: Levi L\'ucio, Bentley Oakes  \item Collaborations: Markus Voelter will provide the requirements for both  the model transformation language to be implemented and the contract prover.  An collaboration with Markus Voelter related to this work package has been ongoinginformally during most of the year of 2015.\end{itemize}
