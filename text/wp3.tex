\paragraph{\textbf{Objective}}: Developing infrastructure to support
restricting a language according to (some) standard.\vspace{.2cm}\\
Supporting language restrictions in order to produce safer code is very relevant
in practice. Various standards specify such restrictions.
Example include MISRA C\footnote{http://www.misra-c.com/} and CERT Coding
Standard\footnote{https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/SEI+CERT+Coding+Standards}.
Coding guidelines are also example of language restrictions, used widely 
in programming practice.

Given a language developed in mbeddr, we want to be able to restrict its usage
for a particular application or domain. Such restrictions are typically
implemented as a collection of \emph{rules}.
An example of a (syntactic) rule would be a requirement to declare all local
variables at the beginning of a block. Another example of a (semantic) rule
would be to never allow dynamic memory allocation, or to always check existence
of a file before opening it.

In this work package we propose developing infrastructure to support
\emph{language profiles}. A language profile is a
set of restrictions which have to apply to a fragment of code
in a given language. Once described in a language profile, conformance rules
can be applied to a given program or program fragment, ensuring its
compliance with the profile.



%To develop profiling systems in mbeddr we will have to perform the following
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Activities:
%   \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Analyse potential useful language restrictions for mbeddr C
%     \item Come up with a number of examples for such restrictions
%     \item Find commonailities and try to identify potential technical problems
%     when implementing them as rules in profiles
%     \item Plan a language fit to formulating rules in language profiles
%     \item Develop necessary infrastructure in mbeddr to implement language
%     profiles in rules as targetted by the research above. This development
%     should result into the following
%   \end{enumerate}
  
\begin{itemize}
  \item Deliverables:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item{\textbf{D3.1}:} A verbal description of rules supported by a profiling
    mechanism and a language within \emph{mbeddr} to formulate language profiles.
    \item{\textbf{D3.2}:} Mechanisms within \emph{mbeddr} for checking a code
    fragment against a profile.
    \item{\textbf{D3.3}:} Implementation of an example profile in \emph{mbeddr}
    (e.g. MISRA C).
  \end{itemize} 
  \item Effort: 7 man-months
  \item HQP: Levi L\'ucio, staff researcher, M.Sc. student, HiWi student 
  \item Collaborations: Markus Voelter will help with finding
  particular application domains where C language profiles are meaningful and
  helpful for developers.
\end{itemize}

% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Deliverables:
%   \begin{enumerate}
%     \item\label{bul:restriction}Restriction of C to enforce a subset of the
%     rules for MISRA C.
%     \item\label{bul:abstraction} A set of domain-specific C language
%     abstractions, built on top of the C subset introduced in
%     deliverable~\ref{bul:restriction}.
% \item Technical proofs of the correction of the generated code for restrictions
% ans abstractions introduced in deliverables~\ref{bul:restriction}
% and~\ref{bul:abstraction}.
% This will involve putting together arguments that make use of the results of
% code generation contract checkers (from Work Package 1) and the CBMC model checker already integrated in \emph{mbeddr}.
%   \end{enumerate}
%   \item Effort: 4 man-months
%   \item HQP: Zaur Molotnikov, Levi L\'ucio
%   \item Collaborations: Markus Voelter will help with finding
%   particular application domains where restrictions and/or abstractions of the C
%   language are meaningful and helpful for developers.
