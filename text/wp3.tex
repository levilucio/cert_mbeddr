\paragraph{\textbf{Objective}}: To experiment with restrictions
and abstractions of the C language to improve developer
productivity.\vspace{.2cm}\\
Besides explicit verification, another means to increase confidence in the
correction of the generated C code is to restrict the C language itself.
Naturally, when the subset of the language that is used is restricted, the
classes of errors that can be made by the developer are also restricted. \emph{mbeddr}
offers us the possibility of performing such restrictions by adjusting the
definition of \emph{mbeddr}'s editor using constraints. An example of such an
adjustment would be the implementation of the MISRA C\footnote{http://www.misra-c.com/} or the CERT
C\footnote{https://www.securecoding.cert.org/} profiles in \emph{mbeddr}â€™s front-end.
In practice this would consist of disallowing for example dynamic memory
allocation, data types that might have different interpretations in different
platforms and other error prone C concepts that are typically avoided in the
critical system domain.
Our goal is also to build on safe subsets of C, by proposing domain-specific
abstractions that can benefit from such safety guarantees. Targeted domains are
the automotive (e.g. by proposing \emph{mbeddr} abstractions that can simplify
construction of C code for the AUTOSAR architecture) and the
aerospace.
% \levi{@Markus: you mentioned \emph{mbeddr} being used for satellite software
% development. Are there standards or specific C abstractions for this domain that
% we could think about?}\markus{They have somehthing similar to MISRA.}
% \markus{This WP would not be done by modifying mbeddr C's meta model because
% this would be an invasive change. Rather, various forms for constraints would
% have to be used.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Deliverables:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Restriction of C to enforce a subset of the rules for MISRA C.
\item Technical proofs of the correction of the generated code for the tackled C
subsets. This will involve putting together an argument that makes use of the
results of code generation contract checkers (from Work Package 1) and the CBMC
model checker already integrated in \emph{mbeddr}.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Effort: 4 man-months
  \item HQP: Zaur Molotnikov, Levi L\'ucio
  \item Collaborations: Markus Voelter will help with finding
  particular application domains where restrictions and/or abstractions of the C
  language are helpful for developers.
