\paragraph{\textbf{Objective}}: To experiment with restrictions and abstractions
of the C language to improve developer productivity.\vspace{.2cm}\\
Besides explicit verification, another means to increase confidence in the
correction of the generated C code is to restrict the C language itself.
Naturally, when the subset of the language that is used is restricted, the
classes of errors that can be made by the developer are also restricted.
\emph{mbeddr} offers the possibility of using constraints to enforce such
restrictions directly in the editor. An example of such an adjustment would be
the implementation of the MISRA C\footnote{http://www.misra-c.com/} profile in
\emph{mbeddr}.
In practice this would consist of disallowing for example dynamic memory
allocation, data types that might have different interpretations in different
platforms and other error prone C concepts that are typically avoided in the
critical system domain.
Our goal is also to build on safe subsets of C, by proposing domain-specific
abstractions that can benefit from such safety guarantees.
Targeted domains are the automotive (e.g. by proposing \emph{mbeddr} abstractions that can simplify
construction of C code for the AUTOSAR architecture) and the aerospace.
% \levi{@Markus: you mentioned \emph{mbeddr} being used for satellite software
% development. Are there standards or specific C abstractions for this domain
% that we could think about?}\markus{They have somehthing similar to MISRA.}
% \markus{This WP would not be done by modifying mbeddr C's meta model because
% this would be an invasive change. Rather, various forms for constraints would
% have to be used.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Deliverables:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item\label{bul:restriction}Restriction of C to enforce a subset of the
    rules for MISRA C.
    \item\label{bul:abstraction} A set of domain-specific C language
    abstractions, built on top of the C subset introduced in
    deliverable~\ref{bul:restriction}.
\item Technical proofs of the correction of the generated code for restrictions
ans abstractions introduced in deliverables~\ref{bul:restriction}
and~\ref{bul:abstraction}.
This will involve putting together arguments that make use of the results of
code generation contract checkers (from Work Package 1) and the CBMC model checker already integrated in \emph{mbeddr}.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Effort: 4 man-months
  \item HQP: Zaur Molotnikov, Levi L\'ucio
  \item Collaborations: Markus Voelter will help with finding
  particular application domains where restrictions and/or abstractions of the C
  language are meaningful and helpful for developers.
